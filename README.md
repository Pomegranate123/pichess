# pichess

A free and open source chess website, an alternative to lichess. Made using Django and Vue.
It was made as a school project and should not be used, it's merely a prototype.

# Usage

To run, clone the repository and run `buildrun.sh`. The site will be available on `localhost`.

# Dependencies

`docker-compose`

`npm`

`python`

probably some more, but I can't think of any more.
